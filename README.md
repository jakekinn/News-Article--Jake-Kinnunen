<p> Frank Bennet built the <strong> GV store </strong> in 1987.  Frank experienced many challenges throughout this journey from the construction of the building to getting business. Attracting customers in such a low populated town and getting enough business to stay open has always been a concern. The store was passed down two more generations to his great grandson Dave. Dave was very successful changing several things, including having an ice cream station. The store was doing great and Dave decided it was time to retire. Once the new owners took over, it again hit a rough patch. </p>

  <p> The <strong> GV Store </strong> had many owners. The original store owner sold the store to move to Washburn. Once again a  new owner came in only a month later for its grand opening! Sadly it didn't last long and he couldn't maintain the store so it's up for sale. Rumors have been circling that a new owner who used to work at Star Liquor in Ashland will be taking over the store sometime soon! His grand quote was <em> "A new owner for a new beginning!" </em> </p> 
<hr>
<p> The <strong> GV store </strong> has yet to meet the new owners but we know for sure if it doesn't go well Dave will come out of retirement and help out the store! If he does come out of retirement he will have his wife help him out and some of his friends. Hopefully the new owner does a better job than the old ones! Hopefully the <strong> GV store </strong>  will be a success.</p>
